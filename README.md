# Spotify-Song-Recommendation-System-
Project Overview
This project builds a Spotify-like song recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The system suggests songs based on a user's musical preferences by analyzing song features such as tempo, danceability, energy, loudness, and more. This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model building for recommendation, and deployment via a Flask API to generate real-time song recommendations.

Project Pipeline
Data Collection:

Collected a dataset with various song attributes from Spotify API or publicly available datasets.
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values, checked for outliers, and normalized numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted descriptive analysis of features like tempo, energy, and loudness.
Visualized relationships using pair plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps to understand how different song features affect user preferences.
Feature Engineering:

Created new features based on song attributes such as mood clusters, genre categorization, and feature scaling.
Model Building:

Built models for song recommendation using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.
Evaluated model performance based on similarity metrics (cosine similarity) and user feedback.
Deployment:

Deployed the recommendation system using Flask.
Developed an API that takes user input and returns personalized song recommendations based on their favorite tracks or song features.
